**Stages in the Pipeline:**
Vertex Processing (Vertex Shader) -> Tessellation (Optional, adds detail) -> Geometry Shader (Optional, modifies primitives) -> Rasterization (Converts shapes into pixels) -> Fragment Processing (Fragment Shader) -> Output Merging (Depth test, blending)

**Each vertex has attributes like:**
- Position (x, y, z coordinates)
- Color (RGB values)
- Texture Coordinates (for mapping images)
- Normal (for lighting calculations)

**Projection**:
- Perspective Projection (Realistic, distant objects appear smaller)
Used in most 3D games.
Example: A road narrowing into the distance.

- Orthographic Projection (No perspective, objects stay same size)
Used in CAD software, 2D games (like Minecraft's GUI).

**Tessellation:** It dinamically adds more triangles to a surface to make it smoother or more detailed.
- Tessellation control shader (How much to subdivide)
- Tesselation evaluation shader (Where to place new verices)


**Shaders:** Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU to control different stages of the pipeline.
- Vertex shader: input: vertex, output: screen space position
- Pixel shader: Compute final color of each pixel, handles lighting, textures and effects
- Geometry Shader (Optional): Can create or destroy primitives (triangles, lines).
- Tessellation Shaders (Optional): Subdivide surfaces for more detail.


**GLFW:**
- Help creating windows, handling input (Keyboard, mouse, joystick)
- Manage OpenGL context.
- Alternative to GLUT.
- Support multiple monitors
- Provide basic timing functions
- Cross platform

**GLAD (Multi-Language GL Loader - Genrator)**:
- Generates a loader for OpenGL functions at runtime (no manual function pointer fetching).
- Supports core and extension OpenGL functions.
- Provides a web-based configuration tool (glad.dav1d.de) to generate custom loaders

**GLEW (OpenGL extension wrangler library)**:
- Automatically detects and loads OpenGL extensions.
- Supports core and compatibility profiles.
- Widely used in older OpenGL tutorials.
- GLAD is better than GLEW.

**GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)**:
- A library for creating simple windows and handling input (now outdated).
- Provided basic functions for window management, keyboard/mouse input, and rendering callbacks.
- Replaced by modern alternatives like GLFW or SDL.
- Example: glutInit(), glutCreateWindow(), glutMainLoop().

**GLU ( OpenGL Utility Library)**:
- Provided high-level helper functions for OpenGL (deprecated in modern OpenGL).
- Included utilities for:
- - Camera projection (gluPerspective).
- - Mesh tessellation (gluSphere, gluCylinder).
- - Mipmap generation (gluBuild2DMipmaps).
- No longer used (modern OpenGL replaces GLU with shaders and manual math).

**GL (Graphics Library)**:
- The base header file (gl.h) containing core OpenGL functions.
- On Windows, OpenGL 1.1 is natively supported (gl.h).
- For newer versions, use GLAD/GLEW to load extensions.

MVP = Projection * View * Model.

**Pitch**:
- Looking up/down.
- Axis of Rotation: X-axis

**Yaw**:
- Looking left/right.
- Axis of Rotation: y-axis

**Roll**:
- Tilting the head sideways.
- Axis of Rotation: z-axis
- Roll is unused, but it's often useful for flight simulations.

**Strafe left/right**: Move sideways left/right, without turning
- Left: Negative right vector (−X direction)
- Right Positive right vector (+X direction)


fov = field of view.
