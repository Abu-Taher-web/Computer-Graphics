**Stages in the Pipeline:**
Vertex Processing (Vertex Shader) -> Tessellation (Optional, adds detail) -> Geometry Shader (Optional, modifies primitives) -> Rasterization (Converts shapes into pixels) -> Fragment Processing (Fragment Shader) -> Output Merging (Depth test, blending)

**Each vertex has attributes like:**
- Position (x, y, z coordinates)
- Color (RGB values)
- Texture Coordinates (for mapping images)
- Normal (for lighting calculations)

**Projection**:
- Perspective Projection (Realistic, distant objects appear smaller)
Used in most 3D games.
Example: A road narrowing into the distance.

- Orthographic Projection (No perspective, objects stay same size)
Used in CAD software, 2D games (like Minecraft's GUI).

**Tessellation:** It dinamically adds more triangles to a surface to make it smoother or more detailed.
- Tessellation control shader (How much to subdivide)
- Tesselation evaluation shader (Where to place new verices)


**Shaders:** Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU to control different stages of the pipeline.
- Vertex shader: input: vertex, output: screen space position
- Pixel shader: Compute final color of each pixel, handles lighting, textures and effects
- Geometry Shader (Optional): Can create or destroy primitives (triangles, lines).
- Tessellation Shaders (Optional): Subdivide surfaces for more detail.
